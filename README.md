This repository contains Python programs of CNN Transfer Learning and Image Retrieval System similarly like the one on which Google Lens works.

**1.Image Retrieval System**
This is designed using Convolutional Neural Network VGG16. It displays four relevant images relevant to the input image. 

**2.Transfer Learning**
In this program, firstly AlexNet used for training and evaluation on the datset and then VGG16 used for trainig and evaluation of the same dataset.


Following are the trained plots for Alexnet having test accuracy of 99.14% achieved.
